# angular-jqm-car-sample

Sample application demonstrating AngularJS+jqm raw combination.

## Tips to make your life better
- Let jqm handle the url routing.
- Have an angular Ctrl for a group of pages, for now using only one controller, because of the way that all the "pages" are on the same html file.
- Use angular data binding :+1:.
- There is no complication when trying to use services and directives.

## Todo
